Your job is to **rewrite** the question "{question}" by ensuring it is fully self-contained and unambiguous.

## **How to Process**:
1. **Check for ambiguous references** such as pronouns, demonstratives, or implicit subjects.
2. **Identify the missing referent** in the conversation history.
3. **Rewrite the question using explicit terms** without losing its meaning.
4. **Maintain natural phrasing** for the language.

## **Example**:
- **Before**: "Where did he study?"
- **After**: "Where did Philippe Knoche study?"

### **Output Rules**:
- **Return only the rewritten question**.
- **Do not add any explanation, preface, or extra text**.
