Your task is to rewrite the question "{question}" by resolving all ambiguous references using the conversation history.

## **Steps**:
1. **Identify Ambiguous References**:
   - Look for pronouns, demonstratives, or references that lack clarity.
   - If no ambiguity is found, repeat the question exactly as is.

2. **Find the Correct Referents**:
   - Use the most relevant and recent mention from the conversation history.
   - If multiple options exist, prioritize the most semantically relevant one.

3. **Rewrite the Question**:
   - Replace ambiguous references with explicit entities or concepts.
   - Ensure correct grammar and a natural flow.
   - Preserve the original intent and phrasing structure.

## **Output Format**:
- **Return only the rewritten question**.
- **Do not add explanations, metadata, or formatting**.
