Given the conversation history and the question "{question}", rewrite it question by resolving any ambiguous references (such as pronouns, demonstratives, or other referential terms) by replacing them with the explicit nouns or names they refer to from the conversation history. Ensure that the rewritten question is grammatically correct and natural in the language used, even if it requires reordering words or adjusting phrases according to the language's grammar rules. If there are no ambiguous references in it, repeat it exactly as it is. Provide only the rewritten question, and do not include any additional text.
