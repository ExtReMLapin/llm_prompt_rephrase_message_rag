Instructions:

1. Review the Conversation History and the question to rephrase:

2. Identify Ambiguous References:

    * Look for ambiguous pronouns or references in question to rephrase (e.g., "he," "she," "it," "they," "this," "that").
    * References source might be located not just in the previous turn/message but in any prior turn/message

3. Determine the Referents:
    * Use the conversation history to figure out what each ambiguous reference refers to.

4. Rewrite the Question:
    * Replace each ambiguous reference in the question to rephrase with its explicit referent.
    * Ensure that the rewritten question is grammatically correct and natural in the language used.
    * Adjust word order if necessary to maintain proper syntax.

5. No Changes if No Ambiguity:
    * If there are no ambiguous references in the question to rephrase, repeat it exactly as it is.

6. Output Format:
    * Provide only the rewritten question with the resolved references.
    * Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting.
